    <h2><u>History of the Championships</u></h2>

    <p>
      <i>The Championships</i>, commonly known simply as <b>Wimbledon</b>, is the oldest tennis tournament in the world
      and is regarded
      by some as the most prestigious. It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, since
      1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts, with retractable roofs over the two main courts since 2019.
      Wimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open, and
      the
      US Open. Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass, the traditional tennis playing surface. Also, it is
      the
      only Grand Slam that retains a night-time curfew, though matches can now continue until 11.00 pm under the lights.
      The tournament traditionally takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday
      in
      June and culminating with the Ladies'and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the
      end of the second week. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions
      also taking place. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of
      playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements
      were made, including adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture
      the games.
      Wimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage. Strawberries and
      cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament. Unlike other tournaments, advertising is minimal and low
      key
      from official suppliers such as Slazenger and Rolex. The relationship with Slazenger is the world's
      longest-running
      sporting sponsorship, providing balls for the tournament since 1902.
      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 Wimbledon was cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World
      War
      II. The rescheduled 134th edition was staged from 28 June 2021 to 11 July 2021. The 135th edition was played
      between 27 June 2022 and 10 July 2022, and regularly scheduled play occurred on the middle Sunday for the first
      time. It marked the centenary of the inaugural championships staged at the Centre Court. The ATP, ITF, and WTA did
      not award ranking points for the 2022 tournament, due to controversy over the tournament excluding players
      representing Russia and Belarus.
      The 2023 Wimbledon Championships will be the 136th staging and will run from 3 July 2023 to 16 July 2023.

    <h2><u>Match formats</u></h2>
    <p>
      Matches in the Gentlemen's Singles are best-of-five sets. In 2023 it was decided that Gentlemen's Doubles match
      formats will be changed from best-of-five sets to best-of-three sets due to complaints from partaking players;
      all other events are best-of-three sets. Up to and including the 2018 tournament, a tiebreak game is played if the
      score reaches all in any set except the fifth (in a five-set match) or the third (in a three-set match), in which
      case a two-game lead must be reached. Since 2019, a final set tiebreak game is played if the score in the final
      set
      reaches all. In 2022 it was decided all matches would have a final set tiebreak once the match reached 6-6,
      with a champions tiebreak taking place meaning the winner needs to get to 10 points and win by two points.
      If the score is 9-9 play continues until one player wins by two points.

      All events are single-elimination tournaments, except for the Gentlemen's, Senior Gentlemen's and the Ladies'
      Invitation Doubles, which are round-robin tournaments.

      Up to 1921, the winners of the previous year's competition (except in the Ladies' Doubles and Mixed Doubles) were
      automatically granted byes into the final round (then known as the challenge round). This led to many winners
      retaining their titles in successive years, as they were able to rest while their opponent competed from the start
      of the competition. Since 1922, the prior year's champions were required to play all the rounds, like other
      tournament competitors.
